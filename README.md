```
app/                # Next.js app router pages and layout
components/         # Client-side React components and UI building blocks
lib/                # Analysis engine that generates recommendations

## Analysis Data

All insights are generated locally using heuristic datasets tuned for different verticals (SaaS, ecommerce, healthcare, finance, and local services). No third-party API keys are required. Results are saved to the browser so you can reopen previous playbooks for comparison.

## Roadmap Ideas

- Extend the category library with additional industries and localization data.
- Export recommendations to PDF, Notion, or Google Sheets.
- Wire optional integrations for live rank tracking, backlink monitoring, and CMS automation.
- Layer in AI-assisted copy rewrites and schema generation for each recommendation.
